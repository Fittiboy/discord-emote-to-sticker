# Convert your animated Discord Emotes into Stickers!
Just run `python emotetosticker.py --help` to get started. The tool is incredibly simple to use!  

# Don't have Python?
1. Right-click the emote in a discord message and "Copy Link"
1. Go to https://fitti.io/e2s?emote_url=PUT_THE_LINK_YOU_JUST_COPIED_HERE

For example: https://fitti.io/e2s?emote_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/821803715350233099.gif?v=1  
This will give you a sticker version of this emote: https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/821803715350233099.gif?v=1
